<p>ith <i>the battle of the Sea of Japan another turning-point in the
brief course of recorded human history has been reached. Whatever the
outcome of the negotiations for peace, one thing is sure: for better,
for worse, and whether we will or no, the West must know the East, and
the East must know the West. With that knowledge will inevitably come
an interchange of potent influences, of influences that will affect
profoundly the religion and morals, the philosophy, the literature,
the art, in short, all the elements that make up the civilizations of
the two hemispheres. It is a part of the responsibility resting upon
the molders and leaders of the thought and life of our time, and upon
our Universities in particular, to see to it that these new forces,
mighty for good or for evil, are directed aright.</i></p>

<p><i>The fruitfulness of those scions of Western civilization which the
Japanese have grafted upon their own stock is to-day the admiration
of the world. In our wonder, let us not forget that that stock is the
growth of centuries, and that it is rooted in a soil of racial character
informed by ethical ideals which we are wont to regard, with
arrogant self-complacency, as exclusively proper to Christianity, but
which were, in fact, inculcated twenty-four centuries ago through
precept and example by Gotama the Enlightened, or, as the Hindus
called him, Gotama the Buddha. It has often been said that India
has never influenced the development of humanity as a whole. Be that
as it may, it now seems no less probable than strange that she is yet
destined to do so, on the one hand, indirectly, through the influence
of Indian Buddhism upon Japan, and, on the other, directly, by the
diffusion in the West of a knowledge of her sacred writings, espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>cially
those of Vedantism and Buddhism. To judge the East aright,
we must know not only what she is, but also how she has become what
she is; know, in short, some of the principal phases of her spiritual
history as they are reflected in her ancient literature, especially that
of India. To interpret to the West the thought of the East, to bring
her best and noblest achievements to bear upon our life</i>,&mdash;<i>that is to-day
the problem of Oriental philology.</i></p>

<p><i>The Harvard Oriental Series embodies an attempt to present to Western
scholars, in trustworthy texts and translations, some of the greatest
works of the Hindu literature and philosophy and religion, together
with certain instruments, such as the Vedic Concordance or the History
of the Beast-fable, for their critical study or elucidation. Some
account of the volumes completed or in progress may be found at the
end of this book. Dr. Ryder, passing by for the present the more
momentous themes of religion and philosophy, has in this volume
attempted to show what the Indian genius, in its strength and in its
weakness, could do in the field of literature pure and simple. The
timeliness of the Series as a whole is an eloquent tribute to the
discernment of my loved and unforgotten pupil and friend, Henry Clarke
Warren. In him were united not only the will and the ability to
establish such a publication as this, but also the learning and
insight which enabled him to forecast in a general way its
possibilities of usefulness. He knew that the East had many a lesson
to teach the West; but whether the lesson be repose of spirit or
hygiene of the soldier in the field, whether it be the divine
immanence or simplicity of life or the overcoming of evil with good,
he knew that the first lesson to be taught us was the teachable habit
of mind.</i></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_02.jpg" alt="T" width="50" height="50" /></div>
<p>he text chosen as the basis of this translation is that given in the
edition of Parab,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and I have chosen it for the following reasons.
Parab's edition is the most recent, and its editor is a most admirable
Sanskrit scholar, who, it seems to me, has in several places
understood the real meaning of the text better than his predecessors.
This edition contains the comment of P&#7771;thv&#299;dhara; it is far freer from
misprints than many texts printed in India, and, in respect to
arrangement and typography, it is clear and convenient. Besides, it is
easily obtainable and very cheap. This last consideration may prove to
be of importance, if the present translation should be found helpful
in the class-room. For the sake of cataloguers, I note that the proper
transliteration of the Sanskrit names of this title according to the
rules laid down by the American Library Association in its Journal for
1885, is as follows: M&#7771;cchaka&#7789;ika; &Ccedil;&#363;draka; P&#7771;thv&#299;dhara; K&#257;&ccedil;&#299;n&#257;tha
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;uran&#772;ga Paraba; Nir&#7751;aya-S&#257;gara.</p>

<p>The verse-numeration of each act follows the edition of Parab;
fortunately, it is almost identical with the numeration in the editions
of Godabole and J&#299;v&#257;nanda. For the convenience of those
who may desire to consult this book in connection with Stenzler's
edition, I have added references at the top of the page to that edition
as well as to the edition of Parab. In these references, the
letter P. stands for Parab, the letter S. for Stenzler.</p>

<p>There are a few passages in which I have deviated from Parab's
text. A list of such passages is given on <a href="#Page_177">page 177.</a> From this list
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>I have omitted a few minor matters, such as slight misprints and
what seem to me to be errors in the <i>ch&#257;y&#257;</i>; these matters, and the
passages of unusual interest or difficulty, I shall treat in a series
of notes on the play, which I hope soon to publish in the Journal
of the American Oriental Society. It is hardly necessary to give
reasons for the omission of the passage inserted by N&#299;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha
in the tenth act (Parab. 288.3-292.9). This passage is explicitly
declared by tradition to be an interpolation by another hand, and
it is clearly shown to be such by internal evidence. It will be noticed
that the omission of this passage causes a break in the verse-numeration
of the tenth act, where the verse-number 54 is followed
by the number 58.</p>

<p>Of the books which have been useful to me in the present work,
I desire to mention especially the editions of Stenzler, Godabole,
J&#299;v&#257;nanda Vidy&#257;s&#257;gara, and Parab; the commentaries of P&#7771;thv&#299;dhara,
Lall&#257;d&#299;k&#7779;ita, and J&#299;v&#257;nanda; further, the translations of
Wilson, Regnaud, and B&ouml;htlingk.</p>

<p>A number of friends were kind enough to read my manuscript,
and each contributed something. I wish to mention especially my
friend and pupil, Mr. Walter E. Clark, of Harvard University,
whose careful reading of both text and translation was fruitful of
many good suggestions.</p>

<p>But by far my greatest personal indebtedness is to Professor
Lanman, whose generous interest in my work has never flagged
from the day when I began the study of Sanskrit under his guidance.
He has criticized this translation with the utmost rigor; indeed,
the pages are few which have not witnessed some improvement
from his hand. It is to him also that I owe the accuracy
and beauty which characterize the printed book: nothing has been
hard enough to weary him, nothing small enough to escape him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
And more than all else, I am grateful to him for the opportunity
of publishing in the Harvard Oriental Series; for this series is that
enterprise which, since the death of Professor Whitney, most
honorably upholds in this country the standards of accurate scholarship
set by the greatest of American Sanskritists.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h2>I. THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_03.jpg" alt="C" width="46" height="50" /></div>
<p>oncerning the life, the date, and the very identity<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of
King Sh&#363;draka, the reputed author of The Little Clay Cart,
we are curiously ignorant. No other work is ascribed to him, and
we have no direct information about him, beyond the somewhat
fanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to be
sure, many tales which cluster about the name of King Sh&#363;draka,
but none of them represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of
information may prove, to some extent at least, a disguised blessing.
For our ignorance of external fact compels a closer study of
the text, if we would find out what manner of man it was who
wrote the play. And the case of King Sh&#363;draka is by no means
unique in India; in regard to every great Sanskrit writer,&mdash;so bare
is Sanskrit literature of biography,&mdash;we are forced to concentrate
attention on the man as he reveals himself in his works. First, however,
it may be worth while to compare Sh&#363;draka with two other
great dramatists of India, and thus to discover, if we may, in what
ways he excels them or is excelled by them.</p>

<p>K&#257;lid&#257;sa, Sh&#363;draka, Bhavabh&#363;ti&mdash;assuredly, these are the greatest
names in the history of the Indian drama. So different are these
men, and so great, that it is not possible to assert for any one of
them such supremacy as Shakspere holds in the English drama.
It is true that K&#257;lid&#257;sa's dramatic masterpiece, the Shakuntal&#257;,
is the most widely known of the Indian plays. It is true that the
tender and elegant K&#257;lid&#257;sa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>enthusiasm, the "Shakspere of India." But this rather exclusive
admiration of the Shakuntal&#257; results from lack of information
about the other great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due
to the accident that only the Shakuntal&#257; became known in translation
at a time when romantic Europe was in full sympathy with
the literature of India.</p>

<p>Bhavabh&#363;ti, too, is far less widely known than K&#257;lid&#257;sa; and for this
the reason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabh&#363;ti's style, his
lack of humor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his
being a truly popular poet. With reference to K&#257;lid&#257;sa, he holds a
position such as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will
always seem to minds that sympathize with his grandeur<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the greatest
of Indian poets; while by other equally discerning minds of another
order he will be admired, but not passionately loved.</p>

<p>Yet however great the difference between K&#257;lid&#257;sa, "the grace
of poetry,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Bhavabh&#363;ti, "the master of eloquence,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> these two
authors are far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of
them with the author of The Little Clay Cart. K&#257;lid&#257;sa and Bhavabh&#363;ti
are Hindus of the Hindus; the Shakuntal&#257; and the Latter
Acts of R&#257;ma could have been written nowhere save in India:
but Sh&#363;draka, alone in the long line of Indian dramatists, has a
cosmopolitan character. Shakuntal&#257; is a Hindu maid, M&#257;dhava is
a Hindu hero; but Sansth&#257;naka and Maitreya and Madanik&#257; are
citizens of the world. In some of the more striking characteristics of
Sanskrit literature&mdash;in its fondness for system, its elaboration of
style, its love of epigram&mdash;K&#257;lid&#257;sa and Bhavabh&#363;ti are far truer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>to their native land than is Sh&#363;draka. In Sh&#363;draka we find few
of those splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> say, "it is only
the words which stop, the sense goes on,"&mdash;phrases like K&#257;lid&#257;sa's<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"there are doors of the inevitable everywhere," or Bhavabh&#363;ti's<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "for
causeless love there is no remedy." As regards the predominance of
swift-moving action over the poetical expression of great truths,
The Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of R&#257;ma as
Macbeth does to Hamlet. Again, Sh&#363;draka's style is simple and direct,
a rare quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages
of higher emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Sh&#363;draka
cannot infuse into mere language the charm which we find in K&#257;lid&#257;sa
or the majesty which we find in Bhavabh&#363;ti.</p>

<p>Yet Sh&#363;draka's limitations in regard to stylistic power are not
without their compensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality
and enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved the
death of Sanskrit literature. Now just at this point, where other
Hindu writers are weak, Sh&#363;draka stands forth pre&euml;minent. Nowhere
else in the hundreds of Sanskrit dramas do we find such variety,
and such drawing of character, as in The Little Clay Cart;
and nowhere else, in the drama at least, is there such humor. Let
us consider, a little more in detail, these three characteristics of
our author; his variety, his skill in the drawing of character, his
humor.</p>

<p>To gain a rough idea of Sh&#363;draka's variety, we have only to recall
the names of the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who
Gambled and The Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The
Storm; and The Swapping of the Bullock-carts is closely succeeded
by The Strangling of Vasantasen&#257;. From farce to tragedy, from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>satire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian.
Here we have philosophy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="i0"><i>The lack of money is the root of all evil.</i><span class="linenum">(<i>i. 14</i>)</span><br /></span>
</div>

<p>And pathos:<br />
<br />
<span class="i0"><i>My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>My limbs polluted by the clinging mud</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And for the fragrant incense of my blood.</i>
<span class="linenum">(<i>x. 3</i>)</span><br /></span>
</p>

<p>And nature description:<br />


<br />
<span class="i0"><i>But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>This golden cord that trembles on the breast</i><br /></span>

<span class="i8"><i>As telling where your most belov&egrave;d stays.</i><span class="linenum">(<i>v. 33</i>)</span><br /></span>

</p>

<p>It is natural that Sh&#363;draka should choose for the expression of
matters so diverse that type of drama which gives the greatest
scope to the author's creative power. This type is the so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
"drama of invention,"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a category curiously subordinated in India
to the heroic drama, the plot of which is drawn from history or
mythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the only extant drama
which fulfils the spirit of the drama of invention, as defined by the
Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of the "M&#257;lat&#299; and M&#257;dhava,"
or of the "Mallik&#257; and M&#257;ruta," is in no true sense the invention
of the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama
of invention which is "full of rascals."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But a spirit so powerful as that of King Sh&#363;draka could not be
confined within the strait-jacket of the minute, and sometimes
puerile, rules of the technical works. In the very title of the drama,
he has disregarded the rule<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that the name of a drama of invention
should be formed by compounding the names of heroine and hero.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Again, the books prescribe<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that the hero shall appear in every act;
yet Ch&#257;rudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and viii. And
further, various characters, Vasantasen&#257;, Maitreya, the courtier,
and others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too
closely to the technical definitions.</p>

<p>The characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even
when the type makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case
of Ch&#257;rudatta, the character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
or even R&#257;ma<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> can hardly be said to live. Sh&#363;draka's men are better
individualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates him
sharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws on every class of
society, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and the
housemaid.</p>

<p>His greatest character is unquestionably Sansth&#257;naka, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>combination of ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater
than Cloten, who, after strangling an innocent woman, can say:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
"Oh, come! Let's go and play in the pond." Most attractive characters
are the five<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> conspirators, men whose home is "east of Suez
and the ten commandments." They live from hand to mouth, ready
at any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution,
and preserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their
irresistible conceit. And side by side with them moves the hero
Ch&#257;rudatta, the Buddhist beau-ideal of manhood,<br />
<br />

<span class="i0"><i>A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low</i>.<span class="linenum">(<i>i. 48</i>)</span><br /></span>
</p>

<p>To him, life itself is not dear, but only honor.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He values wealth
only as it supplies him with the means of serving others. We may,
with some justice, compare him with Antonio in The Merchant
of Venice. There is some inconsistency, from our point of view,
in making such a character the hero of a love-drama; and indeed,
it is Vasantasen&#257; who does most of the love-making.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Vasantasen&#257; is a character with neither the girlish charm of
Shakuntal&#257;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> nor the mature womanly dignity of S&#299;t&#257;.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> She is
more admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her
love as true as steel; this too, in a social position which makes such
constancy difficult. Yet she cannot be called a great character; she
does not seem so true to life as her clever maid, Madanik&#257;. In
making the heroine of his play a courtezan, Sh&#363;draka follows a
suggestion of the technical works on the drama; he does not
thereby cast any imputation of ill on Vasantasen&#257;'s character. The
courtezan class in India corresponded roughly to the het&aelig;r&aelig; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>ancient Greece or the geishas of Japan; it was possible to be a
courtezan and retain one's self-respect. Yet the inherited<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> way of
life proves distasteful to Vasantasen&#257;; her one desire is to escape
its limitations and its dangers by becoming a legal wife.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In Maitreya, the Vid&#363;shaka, we find an instance of our author's
masterly skill in giving life to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition.
The Vid&#363;shaka is a stock character who has something in
common with a jester; and in Maitreya the essential traits of the
character&mdash;eagerness for good food and other creature comforts,
and blundering devotion to his friend&mdash;are retained, to be sure,
but clarified and elevated by his quaint humor and his readiness
to follow Ch&#257;rudatta even in death. The grosser traits of the typical
Vid&#363;shaka are lacking. Maitreya is neither a glutton nor a fool,
but a simple-minded, whole-hearted friend.</p>

<p>The courtier is another character suggested by the technical
works, and transformed by the genius of Sh&#363;draka. He is a man
not only of education and social refinement, but also of real nobility
of nature. But he is in a false position from the first, this
true gentleman at the wretched court of King P&#257;laka; at last he
finds the courage to break away, and risks life, and all that makes
life attractive, by backing Aryaka. Of all the conspirators, it is he
who runs the greatest risk. To his protection of Vasantasen&#257; is
added a touch of infinite pathos when we remember that he was
himself in love with her.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Only when Vasantasen&#257; leaves him<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> without
a thought, to enter Ch&#257;rudatta's house, does he realize how
much he loves her; then, indeed, he breaks forth in words of the
most passionate jealousy. We need not linger over the other characters,
except to observe that each has his marked individuality,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>and that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society that
seems at first so remote.</p>

<p>Sh&#363;draka's humor is the third of his vitally distinguishing qualities.
This humor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its
situations. The plays on words can seldom be adequately reproduced in
translation, but the situations are independent of language. And
Sh&#363;draka's humor runs the whole gamut, from grim to farcical, from
satirical to quaint. Its variety and keenness are such that King
Sh&#363;draka need not fear a comparison with the greatest of Occidental
writers of comedies.</p>

<p>It remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously,
it is too long. More than this, the main action halts through acts ii.
to v., and during these episodic acts we almost forget that the main
plot concerns the love of Vasantasen&#257; and Ch&#257;rudatta. Indeed, we have in
The Little Clay Cart the material for two plays. The larger part of act
i. forms with acts vi. to x. a consistent and ingenious plot; while the
remainder of act i. might be combined with acts iii. to v. to make a
pleasing comedy of lighter tone. The second act, clever as it is, has
little real connection either with the main plot or with the story of
the gems. The breadth of treatment which is observable in this play is
found in many other specimens of the Sanskrit drama, which has set
itself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The lack of
dramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by lyrical
beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we
might not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than
as dramas. In The Little Clay Cart, at any rate, we could ill afford to
spare a single scene, even though the very richness and variety of the
play remove it from the class of the world's greatest dramas.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_TRANSLATION" id="THE_TRANSLATION"></a>II. THE TRANSLATION</h2>
<p>The following translation is sufficiently different from previous
translations of Indian plays to require a word of explanation. The
difference consists chiefly in the manner in which I have endeavored to
preserve the form of the original. The Indian plays are written in
mingled prose and verse; and the verse portion forms so large a part of
the whole that the manner in which it is rendered is of much importance.
Now this verse is not analogous to the iambic trimeter of Sophocles or
the blank verse of Shakspere, but roughly corresponds to the Greek
choruses or the occasional rhymed songs of the Elizabethan stage. In
other words, the verse portion of a Sanskrit drama is not narrative; it
is sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: each stanza sums up
the emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue has made
upon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form of
the rhymed stanza; and so, although rhymed verse is very rarely employed
in classical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate vehicle for the
translation of the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we
occasionally find stanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank
verse, and, more frequently, stanzas which are so prosaic as not to
deserve a rendering in English verse at all.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But, as the present
translation may be regarded as in some sort an experiment, I have
preferred to hold rigidly to the distinction found in the original
between simple prose and types of stanza which seem to me to correspond
to English rhymed verse.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into
rhymed verse, cannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>disadvantage I have used my best pains to minimize. I hope it
may be said that nothing of real moment has been omitted from
the verses; and where lack of metrical skill has compelled expansion,
I have striven to make the additions as insignificant as
possible.</p>

<p>There is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to
imitate the original; this is the difference in the dialects used by the
various characters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other Indian dramas,
some of the characters speak Sanskrit, others Pr&#257;krit. Now Pr&#257;krit is
the generic name for a number of dialects derived from the Sanskrit and
closely akin to it. The inferior personages of an Indian play, and, with
rare exceptions, all the women, speak one or another of these Pr&#257;krits.
Of the thirty characters of this play, for example, only five
(Ch&#257;rudatta, the courtier, Aryaka, Sharvilaka, and the judge) speak
Sanskrit;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the others speak various Pr&#257;krit dialects. Only in the
case of Sansth&#257;naka have I made a rude attempt to suggest the dialect by
substituting sh for s as he does. And the grandiloquence of Sharvilaka's
Sanskrit in the satirical portion of the third act I have endeavored to
imitate.</p>

<p>Whenever the language of the original is at all technical, the
translator labors under peculiar difficulty. Thus the legal terms
found in the ninth act are inadequately rendered, and, to some extent
at least, inevitably so; for the legal forms, or lack of forms,
pictured there were never contemplated by the makers of the English
legal vocabulary. It may be added here that in rendering from a
literature so artificial as the Sanskrit, one must lose not only the
sensuous beauty of the verse, but also many plays on words.</p>

<p>In regard to the not infrequent repetitions found in the text, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>have used my best judgment. Such repetitions have been given in
full where it seemed to me that the force or unity of the passage
gained by such treatment, or where the original repeats in full, as
in the case of v. 7, which is identical with iii. 29. Elsewhere, I have
merely indicated the repetition after the manner of the original.</p>

<p>The reader will notice that there was little effort to attain realism
in the presentation of an Indian play. He need not be surprised
therefore to find (<a href="#Page_145">page 145</a>) that V&#299;raka leaves the court-room,
mounts a horse, rides to the suburbs, makes an investigation
and returns&mdash;all within the limits of a stage-direction. The
simplicity of presentation also makes possible sudden shifts of
scene. In the first act, for example, there are six scenes, which take
place alternately in Ch&#257;rudatta's house and in the street outside.
In those cases where a character enters "seated" or "asleep," I have
substituted the verb "appear" for the verb "enter"; yet I am not
sure that this concession to realism is wise.</p>

<p>The system of transliteration which I have adopted is intended to render
the pronunciation of proper names as simple as may be to the English
reader. The consonants are to be pronounced as in English,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the
vowels as in Italian. Diacritical marks have been avoided, with the
exception of the macron. This sign has been used consistently<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to
mark long vowels except <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>, which are always long.
Three rules suffice for the placing of the accent. A long penult is
accented: Maitr&eacute;ya, Ch&#257;rudatta. If the penult is short, the antepenult
is accented provided it be long: Sanstha&#772;&#769;naka. If both penult and
antepenult of a four-syllabled word are short, the pre-antepenultimate
receives the accent: M&aacute;danik&#257;, Stha&#772;&#769;varaka.</p>

<h2><a name="AN_OUTLINE_OF_THE_PLOT" id="AN_OUTLINE_OF_THE_PLOT"></a>III. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Act I.</span>, entitled <i>The Gems are left Behind</i>. Evening of the first
day.&mdash;After the prologue, Ch&#257;rudatta, who is within his house, converses
with his friend Maitreya, and deplores his poverty. While they are
speaking, Vasantasen&#257; appears in the street outside. She is pursued by
the courtier and Sansth&#257;naka; the latter makes her degrading offers of
his love, which she indignantly rejects. Ch&#257;rudatta sends Maitreya from
the house to offer sacrifice, and through the open door Vasantasen&#257;
slips unobserved into the house. Maitreya returns after an altercation
with Sansth&#257;naka, and recognizes Vasantasen&#257;. Vasantasen&#257; leaves a
casket of gems in the house for safe keeping and returns to her home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act II.</span>, entitled <i>The Shampooer who Gambled</i>. Second day.&mdash;The
act opens in Vasantasen&#257;'s house. Vasantasen&#257; confesses to her
maid Madanik&#257; her love for Ch&#257;rudatta. Then a shampooer appears
in the street, pursued by the gambling-master and a gambler, who
demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gambling-house.
At this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-master
and the gambler in an angry discussion, during which the
shampooer escapes into Vasantasen&#257;'s house. When Vasantasen&#257;
learns that the shampooer had once served Ch&#257;rudatta, she pays his
debt; the grateful shampooer resolves to turn monk. As he leaves
the house he is attacked by a runaway elephant, and saved by
Karnap&#363;raka, a servant of Vasantasen&#257;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act III.</span>, entitled <i>The Hole in the Wall</i>. The night following the
second day.&mdash;Ch&#257;rudatta and Maitreya return home after midnight
from a concert, and go to sleep. Maitreya has in his hand the
gem-casket which Vasantasen&#257; has left behind. Sharvilaka enters.
He is in love with Madanik&#257;, a maid of Vasantasen&#257;'s, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
resolved to acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He
makes a hole in the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket
of gems which Vasantasen&#257; had left. Ch&#257;rudatta wakes to find
casket and thief gone. His wife gives him her pearl necklace with
which to make restitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act IV.</span>, entitled <i>Madanik&#257; and Sharvilaka</i>. Third day.&mdash;Sharvilaka
comes to Vasantasen&#257;'s house to buy Madanik&#257;'s freedom.
Vasantasen&#257; overhears the facts concerning the theft of her gem-casket
from Ch&#257;rudatta's house, but accepts the casket, and gives
Madanik&#257; her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he hears
that his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has
escaped and is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him.
Maitreya comes from Ch&#257;rudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay
Vasantasen&#257; for the gem-casket. She accepts the necklace also, as
giving her an excuse for a visit to Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act V.</span>, entitled <i>The Storm</i>. Evening of the third day.&mdash;Ch&#257;rudatta
appears in the garden of his house. Here he receives a servant
of Vasantasen&#257;, who announces that Vasantasen&#257; is on her
way to visit him. Vasantasen&#257; then appears in the street with the
courtier; the two describe alternately the violence and beauty of the
storm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasen&#257; dismisses the courtier,
enters the garden, and explains to Ch&#257;rudatta how she has
again come into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm
has so increased in violence that she is compelled to spend the night
at Ch&#257;rudatta's house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act VI.</span>, entitled <i>The Swapping of the Bullock-carts</i>. Morning of
the fourth day.&mdash;Here she meets Ch&#257;rudatta's little son, Rohasena.
The boy is peevish because he can now have only a little clay cart
to play with, instead of finer toys. Vasantasen&#257; gives him her
gems to buy a toy cart of gold. Ch&#257;rudatta's servant drives up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
take Vasantasen&#257; in Ch&#257;rudatta's bullock-cart to the park, where
she is to meet Ch&#257;rudatta; but while Vasantasen&#257; is making ready,
he drives away to get a cushion. Then Sansth&#257;naka's servant drives
up with his master's cart, which Vasantasen&#257; enters by mistake.
Soon after, Ch&#257;rudatta's servant returns with his cart. Then the
escaped prisoner Aryaka appears and enters Ch&#257;rudatta's cart.
Two policemen come on the scene; they are searching for Aryaka.
One of them looks into the cart and discovers Aryaka, but agrees
to protect him. This he does by deceiving and finally maltreating
his companion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act VII.</span>, entitled <i>Aryaka's Escape</i>. Fourth day.&mdash;Ch&#257;rudatta
is awaiting Vasantasen&#257; in the park. His cart, in which Aryaka lies
hidden, appears. Ch&#257;rudatta discovers the fugitive, removes his
fetters, lends him the cart, and leaves the park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act VIII.</span>, entitled <i>The Strangling of Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Fourth
day.&mdash;A Buddhist monk, the shampooer of the second act, enters
the park. He has difficulty in escaping from Sansth&#257;naka, who
appears with the courtier. Sansth&#257;naka's servant drives in with the
cart which Vasantasen&#257; had entered by mistake. She is discovered
by Sansth&#257;naka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love.
When she repulses him, Sansth&#257;naka gets rid of all witnesses,
strangles her, and leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters
again, revives Vasantasen&#257;, and conducts her to a monastery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act IX.</span>, entitled <i>The Trial</i>. Fifth day.&mdash;Sansth&#257;naka accuses
Ch&#257;rudatta of murdering Vasantasen&#257; for her money. In the course
of the trial, it appears that Vasantasen&#257; had spent the night of the
storm at Ch&#257;rudatta's house; that she had left the house the next
morning to meet Ch&#257;rudatta in the park; that there had been a
struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a
woman. Ch&#257;rudatta's friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
Vasantasen&#257; had left to buy Ch&#257;rudatta's son a toy cart of gold.
These gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and
Sansth&#257;naka. In view of Ch&#257;rudatta's poverty, this seems to establish
the motive for the crime, and Ch&#257;rudatta is condemned to
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act X.</span>, entitled <i>The End</i>. Sixth day.&mdash;Two headsmen are conducting
Ch&#257;rudatta to the place of execution. Ch&#257;rudatta takes
his last leave of his son and his friend Maitreya. But Sansth&#257;naka's
servant escapes from confinement and betrays the truth; yet he is
not believed, owing to the cunning displayed by his master. The
headsmen are preparing to execute Ch&#257;rudatta, when Vasantasen&#257;
herself appears upon the scene, accompanied by the Buddhist
monk. Her appearance puts a summary end to the proceedings.
Then news is brought that Aryaka has killed and supplanted the
former king, that he wishes to reward Ch&#257;rudatta, and that he has
by royal edict freed Vasantasen&#257; from the necessity of living as a
courtezan. Sansth&#257;naka is brought before Ch&#257;rudatta for sentence,
but is pardoned by the man whom he had so grievously injured.
The play ends with the usual Epilogue.</p>

<p>I have finished the concert. And I've been practising so long that
the pupils of my eyes are dancing, and I'm so hungry that my eyes
are crackling like a lotus-seed, dried up by the fiercest rays of the
summer sun. I'll just call my wife and ask whether there is anything
for breakfast or not.</p>

<p>Hello! here I am&mdash;but no! Both the particular occasion and the
general custom demand that I speak Pr&#257;krit. [<i>Speaking in Pr&#257;krit.</i>]
Confound it! I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry that
my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Suppose I go home
and see whether my good wife has got anything ready or not. [<i>He
walks about and looks around him.</i>] Here I am at home. I'll just go
in. [<i>He enters and looks about.</i>] Merciful heavens! Why in the world
is everything in our house turned upside down? A long stream of
rice-water is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black
where the iron kettle has been rubbed clean, is as lovely as a girl
with the beauty-marks of black cosmetic on her face. It smells so
good that my hunger seems to blaze up and hurts me more than
ever. Has some hidden treasure come to light? or am I hungry
enough to think the whole world is made of rice? There surely isn't
any breakfast in our house, and I'm starved to death. But everything
seems topsyturvy here. One girl is preparing cosmetics, another
is weaving garlands of flowers. [<i>Reflecting.</i>] What does it all
mean? Well, I'll call my good wife and learn the truth. [<i>He looks
toward the dressing-room.</i>] Mistress, will you come here a moment?</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter an actress.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Here I am, sir.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> You are very welcome, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Command me, sir. What am I to do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>[3.8. S.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> Mistress, I've been practising so long and I'm so hungry
that my limbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Is there anything
to eat in the house or not?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> There's everything, sir.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> Well, what?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> For instance&mdash;there's rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled
milk, rice; and, all together, it makes you a dish fit for
heaven. May the gods always be thus gracious to you!</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> All that in our house? or are you joking?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Yes, I will have my joke. [<i>Aloud.</i>] It's in the
market-place, sir.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> [<i>Angrily.</i>] You wretched woman, thus shall your own
hope be cut off! And death shall find you out! For my expectations,
like a scaffolding, have been raised so high, only to fall again.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a joke.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> But what do these unusual preparations mean? One girl
is preparing cosmetics, another is weaving garlands, and the very
ground is adorned with sacrificial flowers of five different colors.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> This is a fast day, sir.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> What fast?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> The fast for a handsome husband.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> In this world, mistress, or the next?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> In the next world, sir.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> [<i>Wrathfully.</i>] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing
my food to get herself a husband in the next world.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Don't be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that you
may be my husband in my next birth, too.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> But who suggested this fast to you?</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Your own dear friend J&#363;rnavriddha.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> [<i>Angrily.</i>] Ah, J&#363;rnavriddha, son of a slave-wench!
When, oh, when shall I see King P&#257;laka angry with you? Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you will be parted, as surely as the scented hair of some young
bride.</p>

<p>P. 8.10]</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Don't be angry, sir. It is only that I may have you in the
next world that I celebrate this fast. [<i>She falls at his feet.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this
fast.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Some Brahman of our own sort whom we must invite.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> You may go then. And I will invite some Brahman of
our own sort.</p>

<p><i>Actress.</i> Very well, sir.<span class="linenum">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Director.</i> [<i>Walking about.</i>] Good heavens! In this rich city of
Ujjayin&#299; how am I to find a Brahman of our own sort? [<i>He looks
about him.</i>] Ah, here comes Ch&#257;rudatta's friend Maitreya. Good!
I'll ask him. Maitreya, you must be the first to break bread in
our house to-day.</p>

<p><i>A voice behind the scenes.</i> You must invite some other Brahman.
I am busy.</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself.
Besides, you shall have a present.</p>

<p><i>The voice.</i> I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me?</p>

<p><i>Director.</i> He says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman.</p>

<p class="linenum">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i></p>

<p>"You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy." And yet I really ought
to be seeking invitations from a stranger. Oh, what a wretched state of
affairs! When good Ch&#257;rudatta was still wealthy, I used to eat my fill
of the most deliciously fragrant sweetmeats, prepared day and night with
the greatest of care. I would sit at the door of the courtyard, where I
was surrounded by hundreds of dishes, and there, like a painter with his
paint-boxes, I would simply touch them with my fingers and thrust them
aside. I would stand chewing my cud like a bull in the city market. And
now he is so poor that I have to run here, there, and everywhere, and
come home, like the pigeons, only to roost. Now here is this
jasmine-scented cloak, which Ch&#257;rudatta's good friend J&#363;rnavriddha has
sent him. He bade me give it to Ch&#257;rudatta, as soon as he had finished
his devotions. So now I will look for Ch&#257;rudatta. [<i>He walks about and
looks around him.</i>] Ch&#257;rudatta has finished his devotions, and here he
comes with an offering for the divinities of the house.</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> Ah, it is my constant friend Maitreya. You are very
welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Thank you. [<i>He seats himself.</i>] Well, comrade, here is a
jasmine-scented cloak which your good friend J&#363;rnavriddha has
sent. He bade me give it you as soon as you had finished your devotions.
[<i>He presents the cloak. Ch&#257;rudatta takes it and remains

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> My good friend,<br />

<span class="i0">A candle shining through the deepest dark<br /></span>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Well, which would you rather, be dead or be poor?</p>

<span class="i0">Far better death than sorrows sure and slow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some passing suffering from death may flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But poverty brings never-ending woe.<span class='linenum'>11</span><br /></span>
</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> My dear friend, be not thus cast down. Your wealth has
been conveyed to them you love, and like the moon, after she has
yielded her nectar to the gods, your waning fortunes win an added
charm.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter a maid.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Maid.</i></p>

<p>I am sent with a message to my mistress by her mother. I must
go in and find my mistress. [<i>She walks about and looks around
her.</i>] There is my mistress. She is painting a picture, and putting
her whole heart into it. I must go and speak to her.</p>

<p>[<i>Then appear the love-lorn Vasantasen&#257;, seated, and Madanik&#257;.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Well, girl, and then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But mistress, you were not speaking of anything. What
do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Why, what did I say?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> You said, "and then"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Puckering her brows.</i>] Oh, yes. So I did.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> [<i>Approaching.</i>] Mistress, your mother sends word that you
should bathe and then offer worship to the gods.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> You may tell my mother that I shall not take the
ceremonial bath to-day. A Brahman must offer worship in my place.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Yes, mistress.<span class="linenum">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> My dear mistress, it is love, not naughtiness, that asks
the question&mdash;but what does this mean?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Tell me, Madanik&#257;. How do I seem to you?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> My mistress is so absent-minded that I know her heart
is filled with longing for somebody.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Well guessed. My Madanik&#257; is quick to fathom
another's heart.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> I am very, very glad. Yes, K&#257;ma is indeed mighty, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>his great festival is welcome when one is young. But tell me, mistress,
is it a king, or a king's favorite, whom you worship?</p>

<p>[28.1. S.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Girl, I wish to love, not to worship.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Is it a Brahman that excites your passion, some youth
distinguished for very particular learning?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> A Brahman I should have to reverence.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Or is it some young merchant, grown enormously
wealthy from visiting many cities?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> A merchant, girl, must go to other countries and
leave you behind, no matter how much you love him. And the
separation makes you very sad.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> It isn't a king, nor a favorite, nor a Brahman, nor a
merchant. Who is it then that the princess loves?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Girl! Girl! You went with me to the park where
K&#257;ma's temple stands?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Yes, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> And yet you ask, as if you were a perfect stranger.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Now I know. Is it the man who comforted you when
you asked to be protected?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Well, what was his name?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Why, he lives in the merchants' quarter.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But I asked you for his name.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> His name, mistress, is a good omen in itself. His name
is Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Joyfully.</i>] Good, Madanik&#257;, good. You have guessed
it.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So much for that. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Mistress, they say
he is poor.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> That is the very reason why I love him. For a courtezan
who sets her heart on a poor man is blameless in the eyes of
the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 59.14]</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But mistress, do the butterflies visit the mango-tree
when its blossoms have fallen?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> That is just why we call <i>that</i> sort of a girl a butterfly.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Well, mistress, if you love him, why don't you go and
visit him at once?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Girl, if I should visit him at once, then, because he
can't make any return&mdash;no, I don't mean that, but it would be
hard to see him.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Is that the reason why you left your jewels with him?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> You have guessed it.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Vasantasen&#257; gives Madanik&#257; a sign.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Whence are you, sir? or who are you, sir? or whose son
are you, sir? or what is your business, sir? or what are you afraid of?</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> Listen, madam. My birthplace is P&#257;taliputra, madam.
I am the son of a householder. I practise the trade of a shampooer.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> It is a very dainty art, sir, which you have mastered.</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> Madam, as an art I mastered it. It has now become a
mere trade.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Your answers are most disconsolate, sir. Pray continue.</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> Yes, madam. When I was at home, I used to hear travelers
tell tales, and I wanted to see new countries, and so I came here. And
when I had come here to Ujjayin&#299;, I became the servant of a noble
gentleman. Such a handsome, courteous gentleman! When he gave money
away, he did not boast; when he was injured, he forgot it. To cut a long
story short: he was so courteous that he regarded his own person as the
possession of others, and had compassion on all who sought his
protection.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Who may it be that adorns Ujjayin&#299; with the virtues
which he has stolen from the object of my mistress' desires?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Good, girl, good! I had the same thought in mind.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But to continue, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> Madam, he was so compassionate and so generous that
now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> His riches have vanished?</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> I didn't say it. How did you guess it, madam?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> What was there to guess? Virtue and money seldom
keep company. In the pools from which men cannot drink there
is so much the more water.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But sir, what is his name?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>[37.23. S.</p>

of the whole world? He lives in the merchants' quarter. He whose
name is worthy of all honor is named Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Joyfully rising from her seat.</i>] Sir, this house is your
own. Give him a seat, girl, and take this fan. The gentleman is
weary. [<i>Madanik&#257; does as she is bid.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Shampooer.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] What! so much honor because I mentioned
Ch&#257;rudatta's name? Heaven bless you, Ch&#257;rudatta! You are the
only man in the world who really lives. All others merely breathe.

This is the first sign of success for Skanda's<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> sons. Now first

Golden Lance<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> has prescribed four varieties of breach, thus: if
the bricks are baked, pull them out; if they are unbaked, cut
them; if they are made of earth, wet them; if they are made of
wood, split them. Here we have baked bricks; ergo, pull out the
bricks.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now what shall be the shape I give the breach?<br /></span>

When I entered, I was convinced that this was a palatial residence.
Now then, is this man poor in the fullest meaning of the term, or,
from fear of the king or of thieves, does he keep his property

the seeds that betray subterranean gold. [<i>He does so.</i>] The scattered

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Talking in his sleep.</i>] Look, man. I see something like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a hole in the wall. I see something like a thief. You had better
take this golden casket.</p>

<p>[49.7. S</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered,
and is showing off his poverty in order to make fun of me.
Shall I kill him, or is the poor devil talking in his sleep? [<i>He takes
a look.</i>] But see! This thing wrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now
that I inspect it by the light of my candle, is in truth a jewel-casket
Suppose I take it. But no! It is hardly proper to rob a
man of good birth, who is as poor as I am. I go.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> I conjure
you to take this golden casket.</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and
the wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the
candle. I keep about me a moth for the express purpose of extinguishing
candles. I will let him enter the flame. This is his place
and hour. May this moth which I here release, depart to flutter
above the flame in varying circles. The breeze from the insect's
wings has translated the flame into accurs&egrave;d darkness. Or shall I
not rather curse the darkness brought by me upon my Brahmanic
family? For my father was a man who knew the four Vedas, who
would not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and a Brahman,
I am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl
Madanik&#257;. Now I will grant the Brahman's wish. [<i>He reaches out
for the casket.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> How cold your fingers are, man!</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching
water. Well, I will put my hand in my armpit [<i>He warms his left hand
and takes the casket.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Have you got it?</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>P. 80.9]</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has
sold his wares.</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a
Brahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake
of Madanik&#257;, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged
in darkness.<br />
<span class="i0">A curse on poverty, I say!<br /></span>

<h3>MADANIKA AND SHARVILAKA</h3>
<p class="center">[<i>Enter a maid.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i></p>
<p>I am entrusted with a message for my mistress by her mother.
Here is my mistress. She is gazing at a picture and is talking
with Madanik&#257;. I will go to her. [<i>She walks about. Then enter
Vasantasen&#257; as described, and Madanik&#257;.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Madanik&#257; girl, is this portrait really like Ch&#257;rudatta?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Very like.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> How do you know?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Because my mistress' eyes are fastened so lovingly
upon it.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Madanik&#257; girl, do you say this because courtezan
courtesy demands it?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But mistress, is the courtesy of a girl who lives in a
courtezan's house, necessarily false?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Girl, courtezans meet so many kinds of men that
they do learn a false courtesy.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> But when the eyes of my mistress find such delight in
a thing, and her heart too, what need is there to ask the reason?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But I should not like to have my friends laugh at me.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> You need not be afraid. Women understand women.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> [<i>Approaching.</i>] Mistress, your mother sends word that a
covered cart is waiting at the side-door, and that you are to take
a drive.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Tell me, is it Ch&#257;rudatta who invites me?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Mistress, the man who sent ornaments worth ten thousand
gold-pieces with the cart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>[58.6. S.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Is who?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Is the king's brother-in-law, Sansth&#257;naka.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Indignantly.</i>] Go! and never come again on such
an errand.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Do not be angry, mistress. I was only sent with the message.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But it is the message which makes me angry.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> But what shall I tell your mother?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Tell my mother never to send me another such
message, unless she wishes to kill me.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> As you will. [<i>Exit.</i>]<span class="linenum">[<i>Enter Sharvilaka.</i>]</span></p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> I will tell you. [<i>They gaze at each other passionately.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> How Madanik&#257; lingers! I wonder where she is. [<i>She
looks through a bull's-eye window.</i>] Why, there she stands, talking
with a man. Her loving glance does not waver, and she gazes as
if she would drink him in. I imagine he must be the man who
wishes to make her free. Well, let her stay, let her stay. Never interrupt
anybody's happiness. I will not call her.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Tell me, Sharvilaka. [<i>Sharvilaka looks about him uneasily.</i>]
What is it, Sharvilaka? You seem uneasy.</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> I will tell you a secret. Are we alone?</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> Of course we are.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> What! a deep secret? I will not listen.</p>

<p><i>Sharvilaka.</i> Tell me, Madanik&#257;. Will Vasantasen&#257; take a price for
your freedom?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> The conversation has to do with me? Then I will
hide behind this window and listen.</p>

<p><i>Madanik&#257;.</i> I asked my mistress about it, Sharvilaka, and she said
that if she could have <i>her</i> way, she would free all her servants for
nothing. But Sharvilaka, where did you find such a fortune that
you can think of buying my freedom from my mistress?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> [<i>Entering.</i>] Mistress, I congratulate you. A Brahman has
come with a message from Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Ah, this is a joyful day. Show him every mark of
respect, girl, and have him conducted hither by one of the pages.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Yes, mistress.<span class="linenum">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[<i>Enter Maitreya with a page.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Well! R&#257;vana, the king of the demons, travels with his
chariot that they call the "Blossom." He earned it by his penances.
Now I am a Brahman, and though I never performed any penances,
I travel with another sort of a blossom&mdash;a woman of the town.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Sir, will you inspect our gateway.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Gazes admiringly.</i>] It has just been sprinkled and
cleaned and received a coat of green. The threshold of it is pretty
as a picture with the offerings of all sorts of fragrant flowers. It
stretches up its head as if it wanted to peep into the sky. It is
adorned with strings of jasmine garlands that hang down and toss
about like the trunk of the heavenly elephant. It shines with its
high ivory portal. It is lovely with any number of holiday banners
that gleam red as great rubies and wave their coquettish fingers as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
they flutter in the breeze and seem to invite me to enter. Both
sides are decorated with holiday water-jars of crystal, which are
charming with their bright-green mango twigs, and are set at the
foot of the pillars that sustain the portal. The doors are of gold,
thickly set with diamonds as hard to pierce as a giant's breast.
It actually wearies a poor devil's envy. Yes, Vasantasen&#257;'s house-door
is a beautiful thing. Really, it forcibly challenges the attention
of a man who doesn't care about such things.</p>

<p>[68.16. S.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the first court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the first court
are rows of balconies brilliant as the moon, or as sea-shells, or as
lotus-stalks; whitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them;
gleaming with golden stairways inlaid with all sorts of gems: they
seem to gaze down on Ujjayin&#299; with their round faces, the crystal
windows, from which strings of pearls are dangling. The porter sits
there and snoozes as comfortably as a professor. The crows which
they tempt with rice-gruel and curdled milk will not eat the
offering, because they can't distinguish it from the mortar. Show
me the way, madam.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the second court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the second
court the cart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouthfuls of
grass and pulse-stalks which are brought them, right and left, by
everybody. Their horns are smeared with oil. And here is another,
a buffalo, snorting like a gentleman insulted. And here is a ram<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
having his neck rubbed, like a prize-fighter after the fight. And
here are others, horses having their manes put in shape. And here
in a stall is another, a monkey, tied fast like a thief. [<i>He looks in
another direction.</i>] And here is an elephant, taking from his drivers
a cake of rice and drippings and oil. Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the third court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the third court
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>are these seats, prepared for young gentlemen to sit on. A half-read
book is lying on the gaming-table. And the table itself has
its own dice, made out of gems. And here, again, are courtezans
and old hangers-on at court, past masters in the war and peace of
love, wandering about and holding in their fingers pictures painted
in many colors. Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p>P. 117.4]</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the fourth court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the fourth
court the drums that maiden fingers beat are booming like the
thunder; the cymbals are falling, as the stars fall from heaven when
their merit is exhausted;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the pipe is discoursing music as sweet
as the humming of bees. And here, again, is a lute that somebody
is holding on his lap like a girl who is excited by jealousy and
love, and he is stroking it with his fingers. And here, again, are
courtezan girls that sing as charmingly as honey-drunken bees,
and they are made to dance and recite a drama with love in it.
And water-coolers are hanging in the windows so as to catch the
breeze. Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the fifth court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the fifth court
the overpowering smell of asafetida and oil is attractive enough
to make a poor devil's mouth water. The kitchen is kept hot all
the time, and the gusts of steam, laden with all sorts of good
smells, seem like sighs issuing from its mouth-like doors. The
smell of the preparation of all kinds of foods and sauces makes me
smack my lips. And here, again, is a butcher's boy washing a mess
of chitterlings as if it were an old loin-cloth. The cook is preparing
every kind of food. Sweetmeats are being constructed, cakes
are being baked. [<i>To himself.</i>] I wonder if I am to get a chance to
wash my feet and an invitation to eat what I can hold. [<i>He looks
in another direction.</i>] There are courtezans and bastard pages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>adorned with any number of jewels, just like Gandharvas<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and
Apsarases.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Really, this house is heaven. Tell me, who are you
bastards anyway?</p>

<p>[70.13. S.</p>

<p><i>Pages.</i> Why, we are bastard pages&mdash;<br /><br />
<span class="i2">Petted in a stranger's court.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fed on stranger's food,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stranger's money makes us sport&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Not so very good.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stranger women gave us birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Stranger men begot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Baby elephants in mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We're a bastard lot.<span class='linenum'>28</span><br /></span>
</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the sixth court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the sixth
court they are working in gold and jewels. The arches set with
sapphires look as if they were the home of the rainbow. The jewelers
are testing the lapis lazuli, the pearls, the corals, the topazes,
the sapphires, the cat's-eyes, the rubies, the emeralds, and all the
other kinds of gems. Rubies are being set in gold. Golden ornaments
are being fashioned. Pearls are being strung on a red cord.
Pieces of lapis lazuli are being cleverly polished. Shells are being
pierced. Corals are being ground. Wet bundles of saffron are being
dried. Musk is being moistened. Sandalwood is being ground
to make sandal-water. Perfumes are being compounded. Betel-leaves
and camphor are being given to courtezans and their lovers.
Coquettish glances are being exchanged. Laughter is going on.
Wine is being drunk incessantly with sounds of glee. Here are
men-servants, here are maid-servants, and here are men who forget
child and wife and money. When the courtezans, who have
drunk the wine from the liquor-jars, give them the mitten, they&mdash;drink.
Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p><p>P. 121.5]</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the seventh court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! Here in the seventh
court the mated doves are sitting comfortably in their snug dovecotes,
billing and cooing and nothing else, and perfectly happy.
And there is a parrot in a cage, chanting like a Brahman with a
bellyful of curdled milk and rice. And here, again, is a talking
thrush, chattering like a housemaid who spreads herself because
somebody noticed her. A cuckoo, her throat still happy from tasting
all sorts of fruit-syrups, is cooing like a procuress. Rows of
cages are hanging from pegs. Quails are being egged on to fight.
Partridges are being made to talk. Caged pigeons are being provoked.
A tame peacock that looks as if he was adorned with all
sorts of gems is dancing happily about, and as he flaps his wings,
he seems to be fanning the roof which is distressed by the rays
of the sun. [<i>He looks in another direction.</i>] Here are pairs of flamingos
like moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after
pretty girls, as if they wanted to learn how to walk gracefully.
And here, again, are tame cranes, walking around like ancient
eunuchs. Well, well! This courtezan keeps a regular menagerie of
birds. Really, the courtezan's house seems to me like Indra's heaven.
Show me the way, madam.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Come, sir, and enter the eighth court.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Madam, who is this in the
silk cloak, adorned with such astonishingly tautologous ornaments,
who wanders about, stumbling and stretching his limbs?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Sir, this is my mistress' brother.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> What sort of ascetic exercises does a man have to perform,
in order to be born as Vasantasen&#257;'s brother? But no,</p>

greasy feet.</p>

<p>[72.9. S.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Sir, that is my mistress' mother.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Lord! What an extensive belly the dirty old witch has
got! I suppose they couldn't put that superb portal on the house
till after they had brought the idol in?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Rascal! You must not make fun of our mother so. She is
pining away under a quartan ague.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Bursts out laughing.</i>] O thou bless&egrave;d quartan ague!
Look thou upon a Brahman, even upon me, with this thy favor!</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Rascal! May death strike you.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Bursts out laughing.</i>] Why, wench, a pot-belly like
that is better dead.<br /><br />

</p>

<p>Well, I have seen Vasantasen&#257;'s palace with its many incidents
and its eight courts, and really, it seems as if I had seen the triple
heaven in a nut-shell. I haven't the eloquence to praise it. Is this
the house of a courtezan, or a piece of Kubera's<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> palace? Where's
your mistress?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> She is here in the orchard. Enter, sir.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> [<i>Enters and looks about.</i>] Well! What a beautiful orchard!
There are any number of trees planted here, and they are
covered with the most wonderful flowers. Silken swings are hung
under the thick-set trees, just big enough for a girl to sit in. The
golden jasmine, the sheph&#257;lik&#257;, the white jasmine, the jessamine,
the navamallik&#257;, the amaranth, the spring creeper, and all the other
flowers have fallen of themselves, and really, it makes Indra's heaven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>look dingy. [<i>He looks in another direction.</i>] And the pond here
looks like the morning twilight, for the lilies and red lotuses are
as splendid as the rising sun. And again:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ashoka-tree, whose twigs so merry<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Do friends, like birds, yet seek a shelter free<br /></span>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Listen, madam. The excellent Ch&#257;rudatta folds his

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Folding her hands.</i>] And commands&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> He says he imagined that that golden casket was his
own and gambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master
has gone, for he is employed in the king's business.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p><p>[74.9. S.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman has turned

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] It was stolen by a thief, and he is so proud
that he says he gambled it away. I love him for that.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> He requests that you will therefore be good enough to
accept in its place this necklace of pearls.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Shall I show him the jewels? [<i>Reflecting.</i>]
No, not yet.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Why don't you take this necklace?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Laughs and looks at her friend.</i>] Why should I not
take the necklace, Maitreya? [<i>She takes it and lays it away. Aside.</i>]
How is it possible that drops of honey fall from the mango-tree,
even after its blossoms are gone? [<i>Aloud.</i>] Sir, pray tell the worthy
gambler Ch&#257;rudatta in my name that I shall pay him a visit this
evening.</p>

must not go until you have had a cup to drink." Confound the
courtezan! I hope I 'll never set eyes on her again. [<i>Wearily.</i>]
The proverb is right. "It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a
root, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who never steals,
a village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan without avarice."
Well, I 'll find my friend and persuade him to have nothing
more to do with this courtezan. [<i>He walks about until he discovers
Ch&#257;rudatta.</i>] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard. I 'll
go to him. [<i>Approaching.</i>] Heaven bless you! May happiness be
yours.</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> [<i>Looking up.</i>] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned.
You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> Tell me of your errand, my friend.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> My errand went all wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 132.8]</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> What! did she not accept the necklace?</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put
her lotus-tender hands to her brow,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and took it.</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> Then why do you say "went wrong"?</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride
of the four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before
we had a bite or a drink out of it?</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> Not so, my friend.</p>

<p><i>Maitreya.</i> Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped
her friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress,
and laughed at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall
on my face before you and beg you not to have anything more
to do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any amount
of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts
before you get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan,
an elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an
ass&mdash;where these dwell, not even rogues are born.</p>

<p><i>Ch&#257;rudatta.</i> Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My

his longing. The proverb is right. "You can't reason with

have to come here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with
the necklace and is coming to look for something else.</p>

it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master has gone,

<p><i>Maid.</i></p>
<p>Isn't my mistress awake yet? Well, I must go in and wake
her. [<i>She walks about. Vasantasen&#257; appears, dressed, but still
asleep. The maid discovers her.</i>] It is time to get up, mistress. The
morning is here.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Awakening.</i>] What! is the night over? is it morning?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> For us it is morning. But for my mistress it appears to be
night still.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But girl, where is your gambler?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Mistress, after giving Vardham&#257;naka his orders, Ch&#257;rudatta
went to the old garden Pushpakaranda.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> What orders?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> To have the bullock-cart ready before daylight; for, he
said, Vasantasen&#257; was to come&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Where, girl?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Where Ch&#257;rudatta is.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Embraces the maid.</i>] I did not have a good look at
him in the evening. But to-day I shall see him face to face. Tell
me, girl. Have I found my way into the inner court?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> You have found your way not only into the inner court,
but into the heart of every one who lives here.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Tell me, are Ch&#257;rudatta's servants vexed?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> They will be.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> When?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> When my mistress goes away.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But not so much as I shall be. [<i>Persuasively.</i>] Here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
girl, take this pearl necklace. You must go and give it to my lady
sister, his good wife. And give her this message: "Worthy Ch&#257;rudatta's
virtues have won me, made me his slave, and therefore your
slave also. And so I hope that these pearls may adorn your neck."</p>

<p>[94.3. S.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> But mistress, Ch&#257;rudatta will be angry with you.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Go. He will not be angry.</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> [<i>Takes the necklace.</i>] Yes, mistress. [<i>She goes out, then returns.</i>]
Mistress, his lady wife says that her lord made you a present
of it, and it would not be right for her to accept it. And further,
that you are to know that her lord and husband is her most
excellent adornment.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Enter Radanik&#257;, with Ch&#257;rudatta's little son.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> Come, dear, let's play with your little cart.</p>

<p><i>Rohasena.</i> [<i>Peevishly.</i>] I don't like this little clay cart, Radanik&#257;.
Give me my gold cart.</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> [<i>Sighing wearily.</i>] How should we have anything to do
with gold now, my child? When your papa is rich again, then you
shall have a gold cart to play with. But I'll amuse him by taking
him to see Vasantasen&#257;. [<i>She approaches Vasantasen&#257;.</i>] Mistress,
my service to you.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> I am glad to see you, Radanik&#257;. But whose little
boy is this? He wears no ornaments, yet his dear little face makes
my heart happy.</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> This is Ch&#257;rudatta's son, Rohasena.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> [<i>Stretches out her arms.</i>] Come, my boy, and put
your little arms around me. [<i>She takes him on her lap.</i>] He looks
just like his father.</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> More than looks like him, he <i>is</i> like him. At least I
think so. His father is perfectly devoted to him.</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> But what is he crying about?</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> He used to play with a gold cart that belongs to the
son of a neighbor. But that was taken away, and when he asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for it, I made him this little clay cart. But when I gave it to him,
he said "I don't like this little clay cart, Radanik&#257;. Give me my
gold cart."</p>

<p>P. 158.10]</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> Oh, dear! To think that this little fellow has to suffer
because others are wealthy. Ah, mighty Fate! the destinies of men,
uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to
thee but playthings! [<i>Tearfully.</i>] Don't cry, my child. You shall
have a gold cart to play with.</p>

<p><i>Rohasena.</i> Who is she, Radanik&#257;?</p>

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;.</i> A slave of your father's, won by his virtues.</p>

<p><i>Radanik&#257;.</i> My child, the lady is your mother.</p>

<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Thank heaven! I breathe again. Hooray!</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> Upon whom does the conduct of this
case depend?</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> The case has a twofold aspect.</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> We have to consider the allegations, then the facts. Now
the investigation of the allegations depends upon plaintiff and defendant.
But the investigation of the facts must be carried out by
the wisdom of the judge.</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> Then the conduct of the case depends
upon the presence of Vasantasen&#257;'s mother?</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantasen&#257;'s mother,
without, however, giving her cause for anxiety.</p>

<p><i>Beadle.</i> Yes, Your Honor. [<i>He goes out, and returns with the

<p><i>Mother.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Dear me! Really, this is very embarrassing.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] Any one else might ask me this, but not a judge.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Pray do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts
the question.</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> The conduct of the case puts the question.
You incur no fault. Speak.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> What! the conduct of the case? If that is so, then listen,
worthy gentlemen. There lives in the merchants' quarter the
grandson of the merchant Vinayadatta, the son of S&#257;garadatta,
a man whose name is a good omen in itself&mdash;that name is Ch&#257;rudatta.
In his house my daughter enjoys her youth.</p>

<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka.</i> Did you hear that? Write those words down. My
contention is with Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> It is no sin for Ch&#257;rudatta to be her
friend.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> The conduct of this case demands the presence of Ch&#257;rudatta.</p>

<p><i>Gild-warden and Clerk.</i> Exactly.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Dhanadatta, write as the first article in the case "Vasantasen&#257;
went to the house of Ch&#257;rudatta." But must we summon the
worthy Ch&#257;rudatta also? No, the conduct of the case summons
him. Go, my good beadle, summon Ch&#257;rudatta,&mdash;but gently, without

Beat the drum and proclaim the sentence.</p>

<p>Listen, good people, listen! This is the noble Ch&#257;rudatta, son
of S&#257;garadatta, and grandson of the merchant Vinayadatta. This
malefactor enticed the courtezan Vasantasen&#257; into the deserted
old garden Pushpakaranda, and for a mere trifle murdered her by
strangling. He was taken with the booty, and confessed his guilt.
Therefore are we under orders from King P&#257;laka to execute him.
And if any other commit such a crime, accurs&egrave;d in this world and
the next, him too King P&#257;laka condemns to the like punishment.</p>

risen and falls, his body drops like a garment. Lay these thoughts
